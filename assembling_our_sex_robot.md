# Assembling our Sex Robot
Here is everything that comes with the Master Beta kit:<br>
<img src="everything.png" width=500 height=500><br>
<ul><li><b>USB cable</b>: used for connecting the Arduino to a computer in order to pass data back and forth.</li>
<li><b>Battery case</b>: Holds 2 AA batteries that will power the vibrator and Arduino (not included in the kit).</li>
<li><b>Vibrator</b>: A small motor encased in a plastic shell. Has a wire that can be attached to an Arduino SHIELD so that it can receive digital signals. Used for entertainment as well as for learning to program.</li>
<li><b>Battery adapter</b>: Can be used to power the vibrator with a 9 volt battery instead of relying on power from a computer.</li>
<li><b>Arduino</b>: Converts computer programs into signals that can be understood by simple electronic devices like LEDs, speakers, and motors.</li>
<li><b>Master Beta Shield</b>: Shields are boards that can be used to add functionality to Arduino boards. This one is designed to work with the bullet vibrator motor.</li>
<li><b>Vibrator adapter</b>: The adapters included in the kit can be used to connect to vibrators other than the bullet style we'll be using today.</li></ul>

We won't be using the battery adapter, vibrator adapter, or extra vibrator today, and are going to be supplying our own batteries, so that leaves us with:<br>

## 1. Connect the Arduino to the Shield

We'll start by connecting the Arduino board to the Shield board. This will allow the Arduino and the bullet vibrator to understand each other. <br>

Make sure that each peg of the Shield lines up with a hole in the Arduino.<br>

Push the two boards together all the way (there will still be some space between them).<br>

## 2. Connect the vibrator to the Shield

Next, we'll connect a vibrator (whichever of the 2 you prefer) to the Shield. Locate the clips marked "D5."
