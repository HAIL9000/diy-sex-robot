# Fun With Integers

We're going to start with the simplest possible program: vibrating whenever power is supplied. An integer is any number that doesn't have a fraction or decimal, like 1, 2, or 3. They can be positive or negative, but today we're only going to be using positive integers.

* Download the version of the Arduino IDE (a text editor we'll be writing our programs in) that corresponds to your computer's operating system from https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software.
* Once A
* Copy the setup and loop from the previous chapter into a new Arduino file.
* Change the analogWrite to a higher number so that it will vibrate.
* When you're ready to test, save your file and then click "upload." The program will run when you switch the vibrator's battery pack on.
* Try out a few different numbers to see what changes!
