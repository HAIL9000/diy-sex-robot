# Fun with integers

* This program currently goes up to 255 vibrations per second, but 200 seems like a more reasonable amount. How can we change this?
* Meh this program is boring, how can we decrease the amount of time it takes to get to the maximum vibration speed? There are a few different ways!
* Let's make the program more interesting. How can we make the fade in/out cycle get slower and slower?
